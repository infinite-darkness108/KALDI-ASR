The optional-silence phone sil occupies 39.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.6 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 4.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,17.1,43)
